FFXIV Crafting Optimizer:

-Each step/skill used = node, find optimal path to craft complete/max hq?
-find calculation for how effective skill will be given materials?

-breadth first, maximize progress, then quality?
	-end nodes: dur = 0 or prog = 100%
	-priority queue: pick highest quality reached before failure?
		-alt: pick highest progress/total, then re-sort by quality, cp needed?, num steps
	-BFS: best route, DFS = quickest route find?

-known chunks/gains? Shorthand a combo set of abilities?
	-if durability damage = 0, add following steps to queue too, prioritize?

-possibility space: n skills, m times?
	-graph algorithm, maximizing values? shortest path?
	-bellman ford/ depth first search, but goal is a node w/ complete result?
	-action = node, edges = all skills?
	-weights: progress
	:::: https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/298/graph-searching-breadth-first-vs-depth-first
		-# skills = branching factor, max number actions = height, Optimal # actions = depth
		-breadth first is optimal between the two?
-possibility space: split into min/max possibles, else to 

-nope, tree traversal, visit every node once
	-monte carlo tree search is below? fitness values to prioritize order?
	-traversing infinite trees? use threading/morris traversal?
	-use minimax tree traversal?
	-Alpha-beta pruning: stop when durability == 0?
	-iterative deepening depth-first search?

-Preference options:
	-guaranteed success, max hq%
	-max hq% while still succeeding, with given change?

Stretch:
-Auto updating skills according to xiv database?
-exporting to script
-min craftsmanship/cp needed?





Alternate ideas:
-gathering time cost calculator?
-discord integration for timers/garden?
-cleaning up bag space? inventory api?
